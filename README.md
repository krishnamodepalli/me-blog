# `me-blog` by _Krishna Modepalli_

A `Markdown` based **Blogging** app, powered by [`marked`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked).
This is a clean and simple platform to write and publish blogs with your own **app** and **domain**.


## Why use this?
1. Easy to use and easy to write with just `markdown`.
2. Supports *Github Flavored Markdown Syntax*.


## What's next?
This app is currently developing and be implementing many features ahead. Some of them are listed below.
- [ ] Tags and Posts relations and tagging blogs.
- [ ] Searching Posts based on titles, tags, and author (*maybe*).
- [ ] A - Z Tag page.
- [ ] Infinite scroll and lazy loading of the blog preview in the home page.
- [ ] Recommending relative blogs at the end of a blog (*probably not implementing this*).
